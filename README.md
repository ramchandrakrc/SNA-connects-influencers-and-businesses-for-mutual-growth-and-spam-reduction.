Social Network Analysis for Influencer–Creator Collaboration

This project applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) and graph-based machine learning to map and evaluate relationships between influencers, content creators, and business owners.
The goal is to identify collaboration opportunities, reduce spam outreach, and enable mutual benefit discovery using network metrics, feature extraction, and link prediction.

🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates:
Construction of a social interaction graph
Extraction of network-based features (degree, centrality, clustering, etc.)
Embedding generation for nodes (creators, influencers, businesses)
Community detection to identify niche-specific clusters
Link prediction models to recommend meaningful collaborations
Basic workflow diagrams and code examples
